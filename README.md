## Introduction

As a tech-savvy developer looking to share my insights, experience, and learn from others', I want to have access to a convient tech-oriented blog. This blog will motivate me to effortlessly publish a variety of content, including articles, blog posts, and personal reflections to a wide variety of different developers. 

## Usage

When visiting the site for the first time, users are presented with the homepage showcasing existing blog posts, alongside navigation links for the homepage and dashboard, and an option to log in. Clicking on the homepage link directs users to the homepage, while clicking on other navigation links prompts users to sign up or sign in. Upon signing up, users are prompted to create a username and password, and upon successful registration, their credentials are saved, allowing them to log in. Subsequent visits to the site prompt users to sign in, after which they have access to navigation links for the homepage, dashboard, and the option to log out. Navigating to the homepage displays existing blog posts with titles and creation dates, while clicking on a post reveals its title, contents, creator's username, and creation date, with the ability to leave comments. Comments made while logged in are saved and displayed with usernames and dates. Accessing the dashboard allows users to manage existing posts, add new ones with titles and contents, and delete or update existing posts. Logging out signs users out of the site, and idle users are prompted to log in again before engaging in post-related activities.
